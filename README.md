<h1>Hyperion Controller Service</h1>

The Hyperion Controller Service is a service that provides various functions around Ambilight. Ambilight, colors and effects can be set for different scenarios (playing and pausing of video or audio, display during navigation in the menu or with activated screensaver) easily in the setup of the addon, as well as the possibility to adjust the behavior of Hyperion when starting and stopping the system. In addition, Ambilight can be easily switched off and on again at the touch of a button on the remote control. In addition to the default Ambilight, 3 freely selectable static colors and 3 effects from the Hyperion effects palette are available for various scenarios.

The addon has a function for testing the colors and effects in the setup. The Ambilight can also be switched off and on again via the Programs menu in the Addon menu. 

For the direct programming of a button on a remote control the service can be integrated via the command, where MyKey is your desired button on your remote: 

```<MyKey>RunScript("script.service.hypercon,action=toggle")</MyKey>```
